Mortgage Cash Flow Engine Test

Goal
The goal is to create a program that outputs a fixed rate mortgage payments table. This is a table that shows the amount of principal and interest
that a borrower would pay if they took out a new mortgage. An example of this calculation and a payments table can be found at Wolfram Alpha
Mortgage:

The program can be written in any language though C# is preferred. Please do not use VBA/Excel.

Requirements
1. The application should accept the following input parameters (same as WolframAlpha)
 a. Loan Amount ($)
 b. Loan Period (yrs)
 c. Annual Percentage Rate (%)
2. The payment table should include the following values (same as WolframAlpha)
 a. Year
 b. Ending Balance
 c. Yearly Principal Paid
 d. Yearly Interest Paid
3. Implement the method to determine the payment directly, e.g. do not use a built in library like Microsoft.Financial.Pmt.
